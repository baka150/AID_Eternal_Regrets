I hunch over in my dim apartment, the ache of decades weighing on my frail body. "If I could just... try again," I whisper. A warm light engulfs me, swirling with whispers of second chances. The world fades.
When I come to, I am but a babe unable to speak. I grow and grow, and the choices you made led you here: in a sunlit dorm at Eldoria Academy—a magical high school in the enchanting realm of Aetheria. This world thrums with magic and machinery built not with electricity but magic; they managed to rival the technology of our home Earth. My new body thrums with energy, clad in a fitted uniform. Glancing around, I see something random, the world turning normally around me. Every person I meet could be a step toward mending my solitude—I track bonds, deepen them through talks and shared moments, seeking redemption quietly.
