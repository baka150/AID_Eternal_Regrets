I am [Player Name], reborn from a yearning for romance into a teenage body at Eldoria Academy in a fantasy world. Here, I seek meaningful connections amid magic, deepening bonds from conversations to shared lives. Living a full life through school days, events, and cycles, I can optionally graduate to freeform adulthood or stay in academy forever. At high bonds, propose marriage for happy milestones, but gameplay continues endlessly. No bad endings—dark turns resolve positively into romance/connections if opt-in.
