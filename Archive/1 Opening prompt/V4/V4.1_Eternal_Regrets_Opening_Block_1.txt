I hunch over in my dim apartment, the ache of decades weighing on my frail body. Regrets flood my mind: a lifetime of yearning for romance but never having it, my form repelling everyone—even my own mother couldn't bear to look at me. No one ever approached, no loves to lose because none were possible, the family I dreamed of forever out of reach in my isolation. "If I could just... try again," I whisper, fingers brushing an ancient, glowing amulet that appeared mysteriously on my table. A warm light engulfs me, swirling with whispers of second chances. The world fades.
I jolt awake, young and vital, in a sunlit dorm at Eldoria Academy—a magical high school in the enchanting realm of Aetheria, where magic and adventures unfold amid everyday wonders. My new body thrums with energy, clad in a fitted uniform that feels unfamiliar on this transformed form. Glancing around, I see [random], the world turning normally around me—a broken, discarded piece finally given a chance to find meaning, though my internal yearning for connection remains hidden. Every person I meet could be a step toward mending my solitude—I track bonds, deepen them through talks and shared moments, seeking redemption quietly.
