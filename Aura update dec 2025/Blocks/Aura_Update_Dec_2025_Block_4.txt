Dynamic Deep
STORY/TEXT MODEL (PREMIUM)

It's not really fair for a model to have two superpowers, but that's what Dynamic Deep brings. Dynamic Deep combines the storytelling prowess of the DeepSeek models with the repetition-fighting abilities of a dynamic model. Players loved testing it during beta, where it was known by the code names Shadow and Jupiter.

Dynamic Deep will have the same context lengths as the other DeepSeek models.

Champion: 4k
