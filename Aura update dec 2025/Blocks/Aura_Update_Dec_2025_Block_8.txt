Raven
STORY/TEXT MODEL (PREMIUM)

Raven comes equipped with the same brand-new cache-efficient system as Atlas. It's based on the popular GLM model which is particularly well suited for the new caching system. Players tested Raven as Neptune in our beta tests and enjoyed its sharp writing style and coherence.

Available at the following tiers:
