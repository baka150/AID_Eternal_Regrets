Hearthfire
STORY/TEXT MODEL (FREE)

Not every story needs a dragon to slay or a world to save. Sometimes you just want to stay in the moment: rain on the windows of a bookshop, late-night conversation in a diner, the quiet tension of two people who haven't said what they mean yet.

Hearthfire is our new Mistral Small 3.2 finetune, and it's the lo-fi hip hop beats of AI storytelling. Built for slice-of-life moments, atmospheric scenes, and narratives where the stakes are personal rather than apocalyptic. It won't rush you toward the next plot point. It's happy to linger.

That said, Hearthfire handles adventure perfectly well when you want it to. It just won't be weird if you'd rather spend an hour running a fictional coffee shop.
