NEW FEATURE (BETA)

Choose the right art style for your adventure with one of our six new Image Style model presets. The styles include Fantasy, Anime, CozyStory, Manga, Comic Book, and Cine-real. The presets work with the SDXL model and can be your new go-to image generators for getting the right look with the least amount of prompt engineering.

This feature is currently available in Beta and will be available in Production in January.
