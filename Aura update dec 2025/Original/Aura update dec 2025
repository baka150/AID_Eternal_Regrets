Release Notes
HearthfireNEW FREE MODEL
Hearthfire
STORY/TEXT MODEL (FREE)

Not every story needs a dragon to slay or a world to save. Sometimes you just want to stay in the moment: rain on the windows of a bookshop, late-night conversation in a diner, the quiet tension of two people who haven't said what they mean yet.

Hearthfire is our new Mistral Small 3.2 finetune, and it's the lo-fi hip hop beats of AI storytelling. Built for slice-of-life moments, atmospheric scenes, and narratives where the stakes are personal rather than apocalyptic. It won't rush you toward the next plot point. It's happy to linger.

That said, Hearthfire handles adventure perfectly well when you want it to. It just won't be weird if you'd rather spend an hour running a fictional coffee shop.

Available free to all players:

Free: 2k
Champion: 8k
Legend: 16k
Mythic+: 32k
DeepSeek 3.2
DeepSeek 3.2
STORY/TEXT MODEL (PREMIUM)

The latest version of what many consider one of the best AI storytelling models available anywhere. DeepSeek 3.2 becomes our main DeepSeek option, bringing refined prose, sharper dialogue, and that uncanny ability to write scenes that feel like they came from an actual novel.

We've also doubled DeepSeek context length! Now starting at 4k context for Champion tier and up to 16k for Mythic and above. Larger contexts are available until Jan 18th. Previous DeepSeek versions (3.0 and 3.1) remain available if you've grown attached to their particular quirks.

Champion: 4k
Legend: 8k
Mythic: 16k
Shadow: Up to 128k
Dynamic DeepNEW PREMIUM MODEL
Dynamic Deep
STORY/TEXT MODEL (PREMIUM)

It's not really fair for a model to have two superpowers, but that's what Dynamic Deep brings. Dynamic Deep combines the storytelling prowess of the DeepSeek models with the repetition-fighting abilities of a dynamic model. Players loved testing it during beta, where it was known by the code names Shadow and Jupiter.

Dynamic Deep will have the same context lengths as the other DeepSeek models.

Champion: 4k
Legend: 8k
Mythic: 16k
Shadow: Up to 128k
Month of Doubled DeepSeek
Month of Doubled DeepSeek
STORY/TEXT MODEL | Till Jan 18

You've told us that memory and context are at the top of your AI Dungeon wishlist. As a gift for the holiday season, we are going to be doubling DeepSeek context lengths! This will last for one month until Jan 18.

Doubled context for DeepSeek is one of two experimental model setups we're evaluating to identify configurations that offer the best balance of power, context, speed, stability, and accuracy.

One hypothesis is that players care about context length more than other factors. Prioritizing action speeds for users who haven't hit high usage yet will allow us to support higher context lengths for all users. We will test this new infrastructure paradigm for the next month and evaluate player feedback and cost metrics.

Learn more about this experiment on our blog post.

AtlasNEW EXPERIMENTAL MODEL
Atlas
STORY/TEXT MODEL (PREMIUM)

Along with its cousin, Raven, Atlas is a new class of AI model for AI Dungeon, featuring a more efficient way for managing memory and context. Atlas is the experimental Pluto model that was highly loved in our last beta test. Based on DeepSeek 3.2, Atlas is equipped with a brand-new cache-efficient processor and a shiny new summary system, enabling an experience that remembers and tracks your story much better.

Note: This model is experimental and may have bugs / edge cases to refine. Not all scripting functions are supported. Available until January 18th.

Available to all premium users:

Champion: 4k-6k
Legend: 8k-12k
Mythic: 16k-20k
Shadow: Up to 128k-132k

RavenNEW EXPERIMENTAL MODEL
Raven
STORY/TEXT MODEL (PREMIUM)

Raven comes equipped with the same brand-new cache-efficient system as Atlas. It's based on the popular GLM model which is particularly well suited for the new caching system. Players tested Raven as Neptune in our beta tests and enjoyed its sharp writing style and coherence.

Like Atlas, Raven supports higher context lengths with cache-efficient processing and overflow summarization.

Note: This model is experimental and may have bugs / edge cases to refine. Not all scripting functions are supported. Available until January 18th.

Available at the following tiers:

Legend: 4k-6k
Mythic: 8k-12k
Shadow: Up to 128k-132k

Harbinger
Harbinger
STORY/TEXT MODEL (NOW FREE)

Previously a premium-only model, Harbinger is now available to everyone. Harbinger is our adventure finetune that actually lets you fail. Built on Mistral Small, it creates stories where choices have consequences and plot armor doesn't exist. Characters can die. Plans can go sideways. The world pushes back.

If Hearthfire is the cozy evening by the fire, Harbinger is the blizzard outside that might kill you if you make bad decisions. We're happy to let you choose your vibe.

NEW FEATURE (BETA)

Images can enhance your AI Dungeon adventures, but interrupting the flow of your story to generate a prompt can kill your vibe. Now, if you leave the "See" action prompt blank, we'll automatically generate an image for you by using portions of your story, including story cards, to prompt the image model for you.

This feature is currently available in Beta and will be available in Production in January.
